The mission of Cornell Computer Animation is to provide a community to Cornell students
of any background and of any major with interests in computer animation. We aim to help students 
develop and pursue these interests and related careers from both an artistic and technical viewpoint.

We achieve this by holding weekly art lessons and Maya lessons for students to build new skills or sharpen existing ones, 
as well as holding movie showings weekly and other club-wide and campus-wide events to bring together 
students with these similar passions. 


Later Goal:
We also will have portfolio and reel workships and critiques led 
by more experienced members for students who want to pursue computer animation or related fields.
