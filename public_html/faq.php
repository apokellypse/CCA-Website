                You could prevent the default jumping response with some other method, but for now I'm using javascript:void(0).-->

    				<li><a href="javascript:void(0)"><span class="expand">+</span>When do we meet?</a>
    				<ul>
       					<li>Wednesdays 5pm, Phillips 318 Lab (regular meetings)</li>
        				<!-- <li>Fridays 5:00pm, Olin Hall 165 (movie showings)</li> -->

                    <li><a href="javascript:void(0)"><span class="expand">+</span>What's the time commitment?</a>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Our regular Wednesday meetings are one hour a week. The basic time commitment is very low. Our Friday movie showings are at most 2 hours.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

      				<li><a href="javascript:void(0)"><span class="expand">+</span>What do I have to do to join?</a>
        			<ul>
        				<li>Just show up to a meeting!</li>
        			</ul>
        			</li>

        	        <li><a href="javascript:void(0)"><span class="expand">+</span>Who should join?</a>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Anyone who has an interest in learning how animation is produced.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

     				<li><a href="javascript:void(0)"><span class="expand">+</span>I don't have any previous animation experience. Is that okay?</a>
     				<ul>
        				<li>Yes! Our weekly lessons don't require any previous knowledge. Last year, an estimated 75% of our members had never animated before. We all start somewhere, and you're in good hands. </li>
        				<li>We also have officers available at lessons who can get you caught up if needed.</li>
        			</ul>
        			</li>
        			
      				<li><a href="javascript:void(0)"><span class="expand">+</span>I have previous animation experience. Is that okay too?</a>
      				<ul>	
        				<li>Yes! We have resources and lessons accessible to members with more experience.</li>
        			</ul>
        			</li>
        			
        			<li><a href="javascript:void(0)"><span class="expand">+</span>What if I want to switch from Tech to Art Crew or vice versa?</a>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Being part of a crew is noncommittal. In other words, yes. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>


      				<li><a href="javascript:void(0)"><span class="expand">+</span>I'd like to be on both the Art and Tech crews. Can I do that?</a>
      				<ul>
                        <li>Yes, you could - we suggest though, based on the past, that after the first month you stick with a crew, just so you can get the most out of one, rather getting a bit out of both.

        			<li><a href="javascript:void(0)"><span class="expand">+</span>What if I can't make every meeting?</a>
      				<ul>
        				<li>That's fine, we have a lesson archive on our site so you don't have to
        				fall behind from missing a lesson.</li>
        			</ul>
        			</li>

                    <li><a href="javascript:void(0)"><span class="expand">+</span>What if I can't make Wednesdays?</a>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We always are open to suggestions for new meeting times, and evaluate member availability before finalizing the meeting time before each semester. Email us at <a href="mailto:cornellanimation@gmail.com">cornellanimation@gmail.com</a> with the subject being "Meeting Time Conflict".</li>
                        <li>Also, to help you out, we have all lesson documents on this website, so you can always catch up on your leisure. Later on, we may even add video tutorials for you guys.</li>

        			<li><a href="javascript:void(0)"><span class="expand">+</span>What if I can't art?</a>
      				<ul>
        				<li>We have members who can help teach you the basics, and you can 
        				alternatively join the tech crew, which doesn't require the ability to
        				draw.</li>
        			</ul>
        			</li>
      
        			<li><a href="javascript:void(0)"><span class="expand">+</span>What sort of resources does the club have access to?</a>
      				<ul>
        				<li>We have a budget provided by the SAFC every year which allows us to 
        				buy lesson memberships, art books, and other useful art assets.</li>
        			</ul>
        			</li>

      				<ul>
        				<li>We primarily use Maya, but many of our members have used Blender in the 
        				past. The lab computers we use also have access to Adobe CS6, which includes Flash CS6. </li>
