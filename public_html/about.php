            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Every week we meet for an hour. Our club is split up into two crews, a tech crew and an art crew. Both meetings happen at the same time and place. The tech crew focuses on 3D modeling and computer animation, and the art crew works on character design, storyboarding, and concept art.</p>

            <h2>Mission &amp; Vision</h2>
            <p>The mission of Cornell Computer Animation is to provide a community to Cornell students of any background and of any major with interests in computer animation. We aim to help students develop and pursue these interests and related careers from both an artistic and technical viewpoint. We achieve this by holding weekly art lessons and Maya lessons for students to build new skills or sharpen existing ones, as well as holding movie showings weekly and other club-wide and campus-wide events to bring together students with these similar passions.</p>
            <p>Our vision is that through our efforts we can create a vibrant group of students &mdash; artists, engineers, business majors, and everything in beween &mdash; who are equipped to create and empower and communicate through the varied and exciting medium of animation. This group will produce one animated short per academic term or semester, and will have a prescence on campus.  </p>
