			<h1>FAQ</h1>			
			<ul>
				<li>When do we meet?
				<ul>
   					<li>Wednesdays 7:00pm, Upson B7 (regular meetings)</li>
    				<li>Fridays 5:00pm, Olin 165 (movie showings)</li>
    			</ul>
    			</li>
    			
                <li>What's the time commitment?
                    <ul>
                        <li>Our regular Wednesday meetings are one hour a week. The basic time commitment is very low. Our Friday movie showings are at most 2 hours.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

  				<li>What do I have to do to join?
    			<ul>
    				<li>Just show up to a meeting!</li>
    			</ul>
    			</li>

    	        <li>Who should join?
                    <ul>
                        <li>Anyone who has an interest in learning how animation is produced</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

 				<li>I don't have any previous animation experience. Is that okay?
 				<ul>
    				<li>Yes! Our weekly lessons don't require any previous knowledge. Last year, an estimated 75% of our members had never animated before. We all start somewhere, and you're in good hands. </li>
    				<li>We also have officers available at lessons who can get you caught up if needed.</li>
    			</ul>
    			</li>
    			
  				<li>I have previous animation experience. Is that okay too?
  				<ul>	
    				<li>Yes! We have resources and lessons accessible to members with more experience.</li>
    			</ul>
    			</li>
    			
    			<li>What if I want to switch from Tech to Art Crew or vice versa?
                    <ul>
                        <li>Being part of a crew is noncommittal. In other words, yes. </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>


  				<li>I'd like to be on both the art and tech crews. Can I do that?
  				<ul>
                    <li>Yes, you could - we suggest though, based on the past, that after the first month you stick with a crew, just so you can get the most out of one, rather getting a bit out of both.
    				<li></li>
    			</ul>
    			</li>
    			
    			<li>What if I can't make every meeting?
  				<ul>
    				<li>That's fine, we have a lesson archive on our site so you don't have to
    				fall behind from missing a lesson.</li>
    			</ul>
    			</li>

                <li>What if I can't make Wednesdays?
                <ul>
                    <li>We always are open to suggestions for new meeting times, and evaluate member availability before finalizing the meeting time before each semester. Email us at cornellanimation@gmail.com with the subject being "Meeting Time Conflict".</li>
                    <li>Also, to help you out, we have all lesson documents on htis website, so you can always catch up on your leisure. Later on, we may even add video tutorials for you guys.</li>
                </ul>
    			</li>

                <li>What are these Friday movie showings?
                <ul>
                    <li>Every Friday we hold movie showings at 5pm in Olin 165 Auditorium. In the past we've watched Food Fight, The Secret of Kells, The Thief and the Cobbler, The Illusionist, Life of Pi</li>
                </ul>


    			<li>What if I can't art?
  				<ul>
    				<li>We have members who can help teach you the basics, and you can 
    				alternatively join the tech crew, which doesn't require the ability to
    				draw.</li>
    			</ul>
    			</li>
  
    			<li>What sort of resources does the club have access to? 
  				<ul>
    				<li>We have a budget provided by the SAFC every year which allows us to 
    				buy lesson memberships, art books, and other useful art assets.</li>
    			</ul>
    			</li>
   
    			<li>Which animation software do we use? 
  				<ul>
    				<li>We primarily use Maya, but many of our members have used Blender in the 
    				past. The lab computers we use also have access to Adobe CS6. </li>
    			</ul>
    			</li>
 
 				<li>I want to partner with you guys for a project. What should I do?
  				<ul>
    				<li>Send us an email at cornellanimation@gmail.com</li>
